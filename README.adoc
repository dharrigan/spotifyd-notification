== Information

This is a very simple example of using
https://github.com/borkdude/babashka[babashka] to rewrite into
https://www.clojure.org[Clojure] an
existing BASH script that can be found
https://github.com/Spotifyd/spotifyd/wiki/User-supplied-scripts[here].

I hope you agree that the Clojure example is nicer :-)

== Prerequisites

* https://github.com/borkdude/babashka[babashka]
* https://github.com/Spotifyd/spotifyd[spotifyd]
* https://dunst-project.org/[dunst]
* https://developer.gnome.org/libnotify/[notify-send] (comes with libnotify)

== Usage

Create (or modify) `$HOME/.config/spotifyd/spotifyd.conf` adding within the
`Global` section:

----
[global]
onevent = spotify-notification.clj <client-id> <client-secret> <1>
----
<1> The `client-id` and `client-secret` can be obtained from the
https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications[spotify developer]
dashboard.

IMPORTANT: Ensure that `spotifyd-notification.clj` is in your path and is
*executable*.

== Example
----
[global]
onevent = spotify-notification.clj 12a1d445b4b4a1a4a216508faebb 11b4e44446dda9aea216518fdeba
